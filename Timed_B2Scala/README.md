# The Timed B2Scala tool

## Description

The Timed B2Scala tool is an embedding in Scala of a timed variant of a Linda-like language, called Bach, developed at the University of Namur. It consists of a Domain Specific Language, internal to Scala, that allows experimenting with Bach programs while benefiting from the Scala ecosystem, in particular its type system and Scala program fragments. Moreover, a logic is used to restrict the executions of programs to those satisfying specific conditions. The tool is illustrated on two security protocols: the Needham-Schroeder protocol, where we automatically rediscover the man-in-the-middle attack, and the Hancke-Kuhn distance-bounding protocol, showcasing the handling of timed primitives and constrained executions.
